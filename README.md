Shout out to my project partner s.x.

We worked on a python based object-oriented program for a computer science course. 
The  project  involved  applying  state-space  search  to  a  classic  problem  known  as  the  Eight Puzzle.
The overall goal was to write a program that could  solve  any  valid  initial  conguration  of  the Eight  Puzzle.
We concluded the project by creating our own efficient heuristic algorithm.
Wanna figure out which one we developed? We don't mean to brag ;)

There are 5 python files in this repository:

1. board.py
2. eight_puzzle.py
3. searcher.py
4. state.py
5. timer.py

For functionality, each file must be saved separately as a .py file and called on the IDLE shell. 
Each file contains the script for 1+ classes needed to solve an Eight Puzzle.
