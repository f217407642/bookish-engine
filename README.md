I worked on a python based object-oriented program for a computer science course. 
The  project  involved  applying  state-space  search  to  a  classic  problem  known  as  the  Eight Puzzle.
The overall goal was to write a program that could  solve  any  valid  initial  conguration  of  the Eight  Puzzle.
The final step of the project was to create our own efficient heuristic algorithm.
