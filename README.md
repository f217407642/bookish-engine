# bookish-engine
I worked on a python based object-oriented program for a computer science course. 
The  project  involved  applying  state-space  search  to  a  classic  problem  known  as  the  Eight Puzzle.
The overall goal was to write a program that could  solve  any  valid  initial  conguration  of  the Eight  Puzzle.
We concluded the project by creating our own efficient heuristic algorithm.

There are 5 python files in this repository. Each contains the script for 1+ classes needed to solve an Eight Puzzle.

Shout out to my project partner s.x.
